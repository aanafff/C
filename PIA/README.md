# ♟ CHESS GAME IN C LANGUAGE
As an integrative structured programming learning project, I am going to program a chess game in c language. The game consists of an 8x8 board that has in its rows and columns the numbers from 0 to 7 to indicate the squares of the board. Two players can face each other in a game of chess and see who is the best.

### ✅ INSTRUCTIONS:
The game begins when the board is opened and player 1 must choose which piece to move, for example if you want to move the pawn that is on 1,1, you must write "11". Then the available positions will appear and you must also type the position to which you want to move your piece. The same will continue for player 2 and the tiles on the board will occupy the selected places.

The purpose of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king. This happens when the king is put into check and cannot get out of check.

## AUTOEVALUATION
-1: complejidad 2 (esta bien de complejidad basado en lo que hemos visto en el semestre) 

-2: funcionalidad 2 (solo falla una cosa, al comerte otra ficha estas intercambian lugar) 

-3: código 3 (quedo bien) 

-4: almacenaje 2 (no es tan limitado por el ingreso de datos de cada movimiento) 

-5: documentación 3 (la ortografía esta bien y el video no tan editado pero decente)

##### ‼️ MISTAKE
Because it is a game that needs much time to complete it, the time is not enough to play the entire game.

As an error we can find that at the moment in which one tile eats another, these positions switch, making it not appear that the tile was eaten but moving the other to the corresponding place. It is a minor error that I could not fix.
